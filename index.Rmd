Session description: 
The workshop will introduce some fundamental concepts of how to work with spatial data by using Covid-19 data for Germany using R and RStudio as the analysis environment. We will cover different possibilities for spatial visualization, measures to identify spatial clusters and will sneak into the definition of spatial neighbourhood definitions and the consideration of spatial regression analysis in presence of spatial auto-correlation. Hands on exercise are part of the workshop. Experience in using R/RStudio will be beneficial but not mandatory as general concepts are transferable to other analysis environments.

## How to use these tutorials?

**Code**

The materials were created with R and the R package `rmarkdown`. The
source are multiple R-markdown document that can be
loaded in R, and _executed_ there (just like a Jupyter notebook,
but simpler). To do this, take the following steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub page](https://github.com/GIScience/global-health-academy) of this course
2. Click on the file of your interest ending with `.Rmd`
3. Click on the "Raw" tab
4. Right-click on that page, "save as", and save it to a local copy of `session.Rmd`
5. Click (or double-click) on this file, and RStudio should open it, showing the file
6. In RStudio, click "knit" to recreate the entire rendered document, which _runs all the R chunks_
7. For running individual R chunks, (notebook "cells"), use the arrows "Run all chunks above", after which you can use "Run current chunk"

**Data**

Due to limited time, data acquisition and preprocessing will not be covered in the workshop.
In order to be able to run the `*.rmd` files yourself, make sure you have copied the `.Rdata` files from
[this heiBOX folder](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/d/7e9c2b8b8da24a718575/). 

Alternatively you can run the acquisition and processing from scratch with the [https://github.com/GIScience/global-health-academy/blob/main/00data_preparation.Rmd](https://github.com/GIScience/global-health-academy/blob/main/00data_preparation.Rmd) script.

## Setup

* get R: [https://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com/installing-r-and-packages.html](https://dh-r.lincolnmullen.com/installing-r-and-packages.html)

* get Rstudio: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

* install the following packages within R

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=F}
pkgs <- c("rmdformats","tidyverse","ggplot2","lubridate","sf","zoo","spdep",
          "tmap","tidyquant","readODS","knitr","animation","cartogram",
          "kableExtra","pals","sf","ggpubr","GGally","MASS", "classInt", 
          "lattice", "latticeExtra", "grid", "gridExtra", "dbscan")

# on windows you might need to install the package directly from github
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ge11232002/latticeExtra")

install.packages(pkgs)
```
